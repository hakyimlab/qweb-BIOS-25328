You have multiple attempts.\nfollow the instructions on the paper’s github README page copied below for your convenience.\n\n\nIf you are on a Mac or Linux, open your Terminal (or similar) application. On Windows, you’ll need something like MobaXterm.\nFrom the command prompt, clone this GitHub repository: git clone https://github.com/jperkel/nature_bash.git.\nEnter the newly created directory: cd nature_bash.\nMake the scripts executable: chmod +x *.sh.\nRun the scripts in numeric order, being sure to prepend each file name with a period and slash, eg: ./01_init.sh). This tells the shell where to find these scripts (i.e., the current directory) when that location is not included in your file search PATH variable.\nYou don’t have to type the complete filename. Once you type enough of the filename to be uniquely recognized, you can use Bash’s ‘autocomplete’ feature to fill in the rest of the name for you. Try it: type ./01 and then hit the TAB key to complete the command.\n\nThere are six scripts in total:\n\n01_init.sh: Creates a temporary directory (nature_tmpdir) beneath the current directory and fills it with dummy files\n02_fix_filenames.sh: We created 217 files with date-stamped names using the pattern: DD-MM-YYYY, e.g., datafile-01-01-2020.txt, datafile-02-01-2020.txt, etc. This script uses the sed command and a for-loop to rename them using the standard YYYYMMDD pattern.\n03_process_data.sh: We created a four dummy data files, such as might be output from a spectrophotometer (3 files of “readings” and 1 “background” file). This script pulls those data into a single data file, averages the readings, subtracts the background, and divides by 60 to give a per-second value. The result is a spreadsheet, which is displayed on screen.\n04_geo.sh: This script downloads a compressed gene expression datafile from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database, extracts it, and searches for a gene name given on the command line. Try it with the Cactin gene: ./04_geo.sh Cactin.\n05_filter_geo.sh: This script uses sed and awk to filter the GEO datafile from 04_geo.sh for records with a p-value &lt; 0.05 and an ensembl_gene_id value other than NA.\n99_clean_all.sh: Deletes all temporary files.\n\nFeel free to use chatGPT or similar to explain the scripts if you are not familiar with these commands."

We are Lixing Yang, Haky Im, and Zach Weber and will be walking you through the course. Together, we will explore the current landscape of genetics and genomics of cancer. The field of genomics has made enormous progress over the last two decades, transforming the research of cancer and other diseases. We will survey the state of the art through literature review and hands-on analytical and computational exercises. We hope that by better understanding this devastating disease, we can help push the field forward and enable discoveries for prevention and treatment. In this journey, we will be working together, learning from each other, and supporting one another's success. The homework problems are not presented to you for scoring you but as intergral part of the learning process. If you do not understand what is asked, you are encouraged to ask questions. Our motto is that the only dumb questions are the ones that are not asked. You will get participation credit, regardless of whether your comments are right or not. You can find more detailed in formation in the canvas site ([https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/42065](https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/42065)) and the linked syllabus. We encourage you to join the slack channel and introduce yourselves. Tell us something fun or boring about yourselves. We look forward to seeing you in class. Lixing Yang, Zach Weber, and Haky Im"

Also try using qqplot of the p-values and simulated uniform random variables (show the identity line). Interpret the figure.\nFor your simulation, calculate the entries of the “confusion table”, i.e. the one that has the number of significant, not significant, discriminated by whether they are real or not (slide page 29)\nIn a real data analysis, can you calculate this table? Why yes or not?\nInstall the qvalue package and calculate the qvalues for your pvalues\nCalculate the pi0 from the qvalue results. How does it compare to the proportion of null Y’s you simulated? Interpret.\n\nHint: use the code from the lecture slides or here\n\nextra credit: simulate X as a more realistic genotype using maf of 0.3\nextra extra credit: simulate a binary trait using the logistic regression vignette we saw in class"
