## Goals of the Class

- Learn concepts and tools needed to understand the current literature in cancer genomics and interpret the results
- First month: focus on germline risk factors
- Today:
  - Gene mapping: Linkage vs. association approaches
  - Describe the genetic architecture of cancer risk
  - Discuss Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS)

---

## Linkage Analysis

- Gene mapping method popular before development of high throughput genotyping techniques
- 100's of markers interrogated (causal markers most likely missed)
- Important genes were found with this approach
  - CFTR: Cystic Fibrosis
  - HTT: Huntington disease
  - NOD2: inflammatory bowel disease
- Markers that are co-transmitted (recombination rate<0.5) with the disease susceptibility locus (DSL) help locate the DSL
- It uses families with many cases ("loaded pedigrees")

---

## High Penetrance Cancer Susceptibility Genes

- Genetic linkage performed in the 1980s and 1990s found:
  - Breast and ovarian cancers
    - BRCA1
    - BRCA2
  - Colorectal cancer
    - adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)
    - mismatch repair genes
    - mutL homologue 1 (MLH1)
    - mutS homologue 2 (MSH2)
  - Melanoma: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A)
- To date mutations in more than 70 CSGs associated with high-penetrance cancer susceptibility syndromes have been identified with RRs of 5-100

## 1996 - Power of Association vs Linkage

- Risch N. & Merikangas K. The future of genetic studies of complex human diseases. Science 273, 1516–1517 (1996).
- Many high penetrance (large effect) cancer susceptibility genes were found using linkage analysis.
- By mid 90's discoveries using linkage were dwindling prompting the influential paper by Neil Risch and Merikangas to propose a revolutionary idea of genotyping about 100K loci in the genome (considered in the realm of science fiction at the time).
- Technological advances brought about by the human genome project made genome-wide association studies possible.

## Gene Mapping Methods

- **Linkage analysis**
  - popular before high throughput technology became available
  - based on co-transmission of genetic markers and disease genes
  - a few hundred markers can cover the whole genome
  - low resolution
  - pedigree/family based
- **Association mapping**
  - need a large number of markers (> 1 million)
  - genetic markers in LD (Linkage Disequilibrium) with disease genes
  - higher resolution
  - families not needed (easier to recruit large cohorts)

---

## Expected to Find High Penetrance Genes

- Recap:
  - Linkage and association are main approaches for mapping genes to diseases and other human traits.
  - Before the completion of the Human Genome Project, linkage analysis was the most popular approach to identify disease loci.
  - Association methods are based on the LD between genetic markers and disease genes.
  - We've been performing genome-wide association studies for the last two decades, expecting to find high penetrance (large effect size) genes.

---

## Found Many Low Penetrance Variants

- Instead, we found a large number of variants with modest effect sizes (low penetrance).
- We found that the genetic architecture of cancer risk was highly polygenic.
- This requires better statistical methods to make sense of the discoveries.

---

## Effect Size vs. Allele Frequency

- The figure shows that the discoverability of the risk alleles depends on the population frequency.
- GWAS have unlocked many discoveries on the lower left, but to make sense of them and turn them into actionable targets, we need to learn new statistical concepts.
- Low penetrance = low relative risk = small effect size

## Review: Hypothesis Testing

- **H0**: null hypothesis (e.g., no difference in case-control allele frequencies)
- **HA**: alternative hypothesis (there is a difference, i.e., correlated with the causal variant)
- **Test statistic Z**: in many situations associated with a model
- **Significance level (α)**: allowed type I error (reject null when null is true)
- **p-value**: P(observed test statistic more extreme than the threshold | H0)
- We reject the null hypothesis if the observed test statistic is more extreme than what we would expect could happen by chance.

---

## Review: Hypothesis Testing (Cont.)

- **Type I error (α)**: probability of rejecting the null when the null is true
- **Type II error (β)**: probability of not rejecting the null when the null is false
- **Power**: probability that we will reject the null when the alternative is true
- **P-value**: probability that we will get a result as extreme or more extreme than the observed data point under the null hypothesis

## Regression Approach: Single SNP

- SNP: single nucleotide polymorphism
- **Regression model**: Y = μ + a ⋅ age + β ⋅ X + ε
  - Parameters β are estimated (using MLE, least squares, etc.)
  - Null hypothesis: β = 0
  - Many types of traits can be treated with the same approach
  - Can correct for covariates (age, sex, ancestry)
  - Prediction
- **Genotype**: aa, aA, AA
- **Dosage (X1)**: number of A alleles

---

## Regression Approach for Quantitative Traits

- **Quantitative trait**: e.g., height, BMI, systolic blood pressure
- **Regression model**: Y = β0 + β1 ⋅ X1 + ε
  - ε ∼ N(0, σ2)
  - Linear Regression
- **Genotype**: aa, aA, AA
- **Dosage (X1)**: number of A alleles

---

## Regression Approach for Disease Traits

- **Binary trait**: e.g., disease status, hypertension
- **Regression model**: Y ~ Bernoulli(π)
  - logit(π) = log(π / (1 - π)) = β0 + β1 ⋅ X1
  - P(Y = 1) = π
  - **Odds**: π / (1 - π)
- **Genotype**: aa, aA, AA
- **Dosage (X1)**: number of A alleles
- **Logistic Regression**: beta1 = log odds ratio

---

## Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS)

- GWAS collect individuals (cases and controls for disease or a population sample for quantitative traits), measures the genotype of individuals in a set number of genomic locations (~1 million markers), and performs association tests between the phenotype (case status or quantitative trait) and each of the genetic markers (typically SNPs).

---

## GWAS: Genotype + Phenotype

- The genotype of the individuals is represented as a matrix Xl, and the phenotype is represented as a vector Y.
- Single marker SNP association test is performed leading to a table of SNP-level results with effect size, standard error of the effect size, and p-values.

---

## Manhattan Plot

- Manhattan plots are used to visualize GWAS results. Points above -log(5 × 10^-8) are called GWAS significant.
- GWAS significant threshold: 5e-8

---

## QQ Plot

- A Q-Q plot is a useful tool to present the GWAS results and check for potential issues.
- X-axis: the expected -log(P-values) under the null hypothesis of no association.
- Y-axis: the observed -log(P-values).
- Dots above the 45-degree line (upper right) deserve a closer look.

---

## GWAS SNP-Trait Discovery Timeline

- GWAS have been so successful that thousands of them have been performed since 2005 with discoveries that grow continuously. As of 2020, more than 70K SNP-trait associations are reported in the GWAS catalog.

---

## WTCCC: First Large Scale GWAS

- The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium's (WTCCC) GWAS is a landmark study of 7 common diseases, the first large-scale GWAS performed.
- GWA studies of 2000 cases and 3000 shared controls for 7 diseases
- Platform: Affymetrix 500K Set
- Main paper published in 2007
- Results and summaries freely available
- Genotype data access granted to qualified investigators

---

## WTCCC: Population Structure

- QQ plots for WTCCC diseases show some departure from the identity line early on, indicating some population structure.
- Methods for correcting for population structure were still underdeveloped at this time.

---

## Zoom in with Regional Plots

- We can zoom into the Manhattan plot using locus zoom. These are staples of any GWAS paper at the moment.
- Variants in LD tend to have similar association p-values. This is a good sign. If we find variants that are significant by themselves, this may be a sign of genotyping issue.
